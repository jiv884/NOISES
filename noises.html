<div id="v2">
Have you heard about the news about the virus?
</div>
<div id="v3">
What news? About the spreading?
</div>
<div id="v4">
The spreading is getting insane.</div>
  <div id="v5"> 
I've heard about it.</div>
  <div id="v6"> 
Have you heard about the news about Dr. Li then?
</div>
<div id="v7">Doctor Li?</div>
<div id="v8">Doctor Li. His name is Li Wenliang.</div>
<div id="v9">The hero who passed away? Yes, I've heard about him.</div>
<br><br>
<div id="v10">He wasn't a hero.</div>
<div id="v11">How could you say that? He was a whistle-blower!</div>
<div id="v12">They called him a "whistle-blower" because he tried to alert people about the virus before it spreaded widely.</div>
<div id="v13">
   Absolutely.
  </div>
  <br><br>
<div id="v14">But he wasn't a hero.
    </div>
<div id="v15"> How could you say this? Pay some respect for him!
    </div>
<div id="v16">He wasn't a hero. Dr. Li was a victim.
  </div>
<div id="v17"> Why do you say so?
  </div>
<div id="v18">Have you read this before?
  </div>

 <div id="v19">What is this?</div>
 <div id="v20">A letter of admonition from the Wuhan police, signed by Li Wenliang.</div>
 <div id="v21">Why was this made? </div>
 <div id="v22">For punishing him.</div>
 <div id="v23">Punishing him for what?!</div>
 <div id="v24">For spreading rumors.</div>
    <div id="v25">What are the rumors?</div>
    <div id="v26">That a novel coronavirus started to spread in Wuhan.</div>
    <div id="v27">...</div>
    <div id="v28">...</div>
    <div id="v29">But they weren't rumors. They were true.</div>
    <div id="v30">The city government didn't want people to get panic because of this news. So they decided to make this news 'rumor'.</div>
    <div id="v31">What the...</div>
    <div id="v32">A hero was willing to sacrifice himself for the truth that he wanted to protect.</div>
    <div id="v33">Correct.</div>
    <div id="v34">Dr. Li was a whistle-blower for sure. He blew the whistle to alert people he cared.</div>
    <div id="v35">Yes.</div>
    <div id="v36">But he was not a hero.
    <div id='v37'>I hate people calling him a hero. Even the government started to do that. He didn't choose to be a 'hero', he just wanted to protect his family and friends.</div>
    <div id="v39">...</div>
    <div id="v40">...</div>
    <div id="v41">...Calling him a 'hero' is not right. He didn't choose to sacrifice himself. It's like calling him a 'hero' can hide what the government has done wrong.</div>
